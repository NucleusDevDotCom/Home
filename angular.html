    <h1>Getting Started with Angular</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Install Angular CLI: Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) is a powerful tool that helps you create and manage Angular projects easily. You can install it globally using npm (Node Package Manager) by running the following command in your terminal:</li>
        <br>
		<code>npm install -g @angular/cli</code>
        <br><br>
        <li>Create a new Angular project: Once you have installed Angular CLI, you can create a new Angular project using the <code>ng new</code> command. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project and run the following command:</li>
        <br>
        <code>ng new my-app</code>
        <br>
        <p>This will create a new Angular project with the name <code>my-app</code> in the current directory.</p>
        <li>Run the Angular app: After creating the Angular app, navigate to the project directory by running <code>cd my-app</code> and start the development server by running <code>ng serve</code>. This will start the app on <code>http://localhost:4200/</code> and you can view your app in your browser.</li>
        <br>
		<li>Write your first Angular component: Now that your app is up and running, you can start writing your first Angular component. Components are the building blocks of an Angular app. You can create a new component using the <code>ng generate component</code> command. For example, to create a new component called <code>my-component</code>, run the following command:</li>
        <br>
        <code>ng generate component my-component</code>
        <br>
        <p>This will create a new folder called <code>my-component</code> with all the necessary files for your component.</p>
        <li>Update your app: Once you have created your component, you can update your app to use it. Open the <code>app.component.html</code> file and add the following code:</li>
        <br>
        <code>&lt;app-my-component&gt;&lt;/app-my-component&gt;</code>
        <br>
        <p>This will add your <code>my-component</code> to the app.</p>
        <li>Start building your app: You can now start building your app by creating more components, services, and modules as per your requirement.</li>
    </ol>
